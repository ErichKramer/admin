When printing multiple-per-page, be sure to disable duplexing in the printer settings. 

Under a libreoffice setup-related tab in the print menus, you have the option of printing multiple per page. 
Pick the number that the filename suggests. Check the box to print a border around each page, 
and enter the number of *sheets* you want when it asks for number of copies.

Note that if you're printing in the KEC fishbowl, your copies will come out of all 3 printers 
simultaneously, and interspersed with other peoples' print jobs. The KEC main office front desk
has scissors which you can borrow if you ask nicely, for cutting the handouts apart.
